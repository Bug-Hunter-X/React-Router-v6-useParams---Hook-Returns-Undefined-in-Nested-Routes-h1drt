This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Router v6 where the `useParams()` hook returns undefined or incorrect values in nested routes. The issue arises due to asynchronous rendering, where child components attempt to access parameters before they are fully resolved by the parent component.  The `NestedRoutesBug.js` file showcases the problem, while `NestedRoutesSolution.js` provides a solution using the `Outlet` component and ensuring parameters are available before accessing them.
