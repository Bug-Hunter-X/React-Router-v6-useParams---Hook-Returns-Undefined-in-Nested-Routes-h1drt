In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when working with nested routes and route parameters.  If you have a route like `/users/:userId/profile` and try to access `useParams()` within a child component nested within the `/users/:userId` route, the `userId` parameter might be undefined or incorrect if the child component is rendered before the parent component's parameters are fully resolved. This often happens due to React's asynchronous rendering behavior.  The parameters might not be available immediately.
