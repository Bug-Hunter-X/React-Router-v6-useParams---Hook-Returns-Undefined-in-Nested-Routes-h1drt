To solve this, leverage the `Outlet` component to conditionally render the child components only after the parent's parameters are available. You can achieve this by checking if the parameters are defined within the parent route component before rendering the `Outlet`.  Another approach is to utilize the `useLocation` hook to get the current route's path and manually extract the parameters using string manipulation. However, the `Outlet` approach is generally preferred for better readability and maintainability.
